        Experience is the whisper of time etched into the soul,<br>  
        a delicate dance of moments both fleeting and eternal. It is the silent witness to every heartbeat, the gentle sculptor that shapes our spirit with each joy,<br> 
        each sorrow. Experience is not merely the passage of days but the stories they leave behind<br> 
        the lessons wrapped in laughter, the wisdom hidden in pain. Like the wind that carves mountains,<br> 
        it wears us down and builds us up, defining us not by what we have seen, but by how those moments have transformed us. In every glance, every touch, experience lingers<br>
        a poet that writes our lives in invisible ink, only revealed when we reflect upon the pages we have turned.
